CS-470 Final Reflection

Experiences and Strengths:

• Containers to migrate the web application to the AWS cloud 
• Build the web application in the cloud by migrating the static website and the database so 
the application will leverage a serverless environment
• S3 is host a slightly modified web Angular application
• API Gateway and Lambda replace the logic from Express and Node.js, and DynamoDB 
replaces MongoDB 

 My strength is that I am passionate to learn new things and create an opportunity to 
implement those. I enjoy taking up a new challenge. To have a good communication skill, a 
positive attitude, good grasp of the collaborative, critical things skills and leadership skills, that 
is the key to strength to be a great software developer. 
 The cybersecurity discipline is so broad that standardized paintings roles and process titles 
have not begun to crystallize. I see massive variant throughout enterprise verticals and among 
public and private sectors. This weblog publish is a part of my collection on expertise 
cybersecurity profession trends. An important part of it is to higher apprehend what varieties of 
jobs are available. In this publish I could be capable of pick out the most not unusual place 
process classes as proven on process boards. The Federal authorities has categorized 
cybersecurity jobs into the Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.1 This is a totally complete 
evaluation of cybersecurity jobs that lists fifty-two Work Roles and paintings position 
descriptions. The report is important to study however has a few shortcomings. For one, the 
specified paintings roles do now no longer always correspond to today’s process titles or maybe 
process listings. For another, Work Roles are indexed that contain security tasks.

Planning for Growth:

 Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of 
many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services. Instead of building a 
single monolithic application, microservices split an application into discrete sets of smaller, 
interconnected services that each have their own business logic, database, and other adapters 
connected by APIs to other services.
 Microservices and Serverless are the future of modern tech. A single application may 
consist of multiple microservices and short-lived functions that interact with a range of other 
resources. Given this level of complexity, it can be difficult to trace requests across your 
environment, understand dependencies, and isolate the root cause of errors. To optimize and 
troubleshoot serverless microservices, teams need visibility into how their functions and services 
interact with each other.
 Predicting the cost of serverless applications can be another task. It is difficult to predict 
the exact cost of the operations. Most of the services that we use follow a pay-as-you-go model, 

in which you pay for what have you used and for how long you have used the service. Serverless 
computing products, such as AWS Lambda, work on a pay-as-you-go model. Microservices on 
containers, while relatively cheap to provision, require payment for the instance to run 24/7, even 
if there is no load. Also, keep in mind that you must pay for what type of system or machine you 
are renting. For example, if you use a high-end many-core and high memory machine you must
pay more per hour than for a relatively low-end machine which will be sufficient for you.
 Microservices and serverless allow us to design and ship code faster. If the application that 
you are designing has a high volume of users, then it is best to use this type of architecture. You 
could expect modularity and decentralization to be a crucial part of your application.
There are many features to microservices and serverless such as -
• Autonomous
• Decentralized
• Technology and Flexibility
• Scalability
 Microservices are not just technology architecture. They demand a deep understanding of 
the solution domain in addition to supporting organization structures, communication patterns, 
and culture. If those are aligned, you may find significant benefits. Microservices is the way to 
go, but make sure you use it for the right reasons.
